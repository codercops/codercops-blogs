## Introduction

Python is a general-purpose, high-level, interpreted, and dynamic programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports object-oriented programming, structured programming, and functional programming. It is a simple and easy-to-learn programming language. It is also a beginner-friendly programming language. It is a cross-platform programming language. It means that it can run on multiple platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is an open-source programming language. It means that its source code is freely available to the public. It is a high-level programming language. It means that it is closer to human language than machine language. It is an interpreted programming language. It means that it does not need to be compiled before running. It is a dynamic programming language. It means that it does not need to be declared before using it. It is a case-sensitive programming language. It means that it treats uppercase and lowercase letters as different letters. It is a strongly-typed programming language. It means that it does not allow implicit type conversion.
