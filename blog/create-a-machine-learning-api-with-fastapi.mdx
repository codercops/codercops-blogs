## Introduction

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. It is built on top of the Starlette framework and is designed to be fast, easy to use, and scalable. FastAPI is a great choice for building machine learning APIs because it provides a simple way to define endpoints and models, and it has built-in support for asynchronous programming. 

In this blog post, we will show you how to create a simple API for a machine learning model using FastAPI. We will use the Iris dataset to train a simple classification model, and then we will deploy the model as an API.

## Prerequisites

Before you can follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- FastAPI library
- Iris dataset
- Scikit-learn library

**Gettting Started**

First, lets import the required libraries.

```python
import fastapi
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```

Next, we will load the Iris dataset and split it into training and testing sets.

```python
iris = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

Now, we will train a simple logistic regression model on the training set.

```python
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Finally, we will evaluate the model on the testing set and print the accuracy score.

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}")
```

## Creating the API

Now that we have a trained model, we can create an API for it using FastAPI.

```python
app = fastapi.FastAPI()
```

Next, we will define the endpoint for our API that will accept a JSON object containing the features of an Iris flower and return the predicted class.

```python
@app.post("/predict")
def predict_flower(data: dict):
    features = [data["sepal_length"], data["sepal_width"], data["petal_length"], data["petal_width"]]
    prediction = model.predict([features])
    return JSONResponse({"prediction": prediction[0]})
```

Finally, we will run the API using uvicorn.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="
```

That's it! We have successfully created an API for our machine learning model using FastAPI.

## Testing the API

Now, let's test our API. We can do this by sending a POST request to the /predict endpoint with the flower's features as the body of the request.

For example, we can use the following curl command to predict the species of a flower with sepal length 5.1, sepal width 3.5, petal length 1.4, and petal width 0.2:

```python
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sepal_length": 5.1, "sepal_width": 3.5, "petal_length": 1.4, "petal_width": 0.2}' http://localhost:8000/predict
```

The response should look something like this:

```python
{"prediction": setosa}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have shown you how to create a simple API for a machine learning model using FastAPI. We have also shown you how to test the API using curl. We hope that this tutorial has been helpful and that you now have a better understanding of how to use FastAPI to create APIs for machine learning models.

FastAPI is a powerful tool for creating APIs, and it is easy to use. If you are looking for a way to deploy your machine learning models as APIs, FastAPI is a great option.

## All code in one place

```python
import fastapi
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

iris = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

app = fastapi.FastAPI()

@app.post("/predict")
def predict_flower(data: dict):
    features = [data["sepal_length"], data["sepal_width"], data["petal_length"], data["petal_width"]]
    prediction = model.predict([features])
    return JSONResponse({"prediction": prediction[0]})
```
